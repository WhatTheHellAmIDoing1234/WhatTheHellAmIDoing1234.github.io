Initially, I started this project as an active procrastination. I had study to do, and I used this as a challenging work-around, in order to feel
active, whilst avoiding the responsibility of studying. I'm very glad that I did - It has been a unique experience. One of learning, self-fulfillment
and gratification. I find myself now anticipating learning in order to enable my participation in the activity of building this web-page.
