    <p>
    Psychology from a Psyche is a blog page where I can internalise, reformulate and share my learnings within the field of Psychology.
    The website is chiefly an educational endeavour, intended for myself first, with the fortunate bi-product of social renumeration and accountability.
    It is meant to be a tool for myself to be able to externalise my thoughts, feelings and opinions in a way that is structured, presentable and meaningful.   
    Initially, I started this project as a form of active procrastination. I had study to do so I used this as a challenging avoidance measure,
    so that I could feel good whilst avoiding the responsibility of studying. While appreciating the negative implications of this kind of behaviour,
    I'm glad that I did - it has evolved from a minute idea to an all out project and I am excited to expand upon it. <br> <br>
    
    So, what can you expect to see on this site going forward? <br>
    Well. In addition to cleaning up the gross UI of the early web-site (God help me. I'm doing all the code myself, having studied HTML in highschool years ago).
    I'm planning on - probably quite pedantically - sharing some interesting content from my studies, as well as some personal interpretations. Anything
    regarding Psychology, Phenomenology or some obscure existential consideration I might have. So I guess.. Basically anything...   
    You can expect to see deep philosophical hypotheticals surrounding the implications of consciousness & existence, alongside empirically-based theories around cognitive processes and the like.
    Honestly, the content will likely vary a great deal depending on how I'm feeling on that particular day. <br> <br>
    
    Currently, the website is in early stages but I do have few quite major quality of life improvements that I intend to implement. If you are viewing this,
    and it is still seemingly incomplete, congratulations! I have either: 
    </p>
        <ul>Abandoned the project - God why?</ul>
        <ul>Shown this to you early on - Please provide quite an astute and evaluative critique indeed.</ul>
        <ul>Shown myself as an incompetent programmer and clearly over-extended myself - Whoops.</ul>
    <p>
    In all cases, if you are reading this currently, whatever state the site is in, no matter how long its been since I've committed to this project, feel free to reach out and start a conversation about it.
