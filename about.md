<h2>An Introduction to Myself, my Ideas, my Knowledge & my Views</h2>
        
        <h3>Myself</h3>

        <p>My name is Zavier Sutton, I was born in 2004, I'm currently studying Psychology at an undergraduate level in 
    Brisbane, Queensland. Since I was young I have always felt an intruige and a drive towards forming an understanding of the unknown. I believe 
    the questions of consciousness, intelligence and experience are the most profound and intruiging existential questions one 
    could ask. </p>
        
        <h3>My Ideas</h3>
        <p>
    It has always been a desire of mine (as with most human beings) to leave behind a far-reaching legacy, the way that I envision
    myself doing that is by meaningfully contributing to the expanding pool of Human knowledge. If you know me you will know that
    I harbour a wealth of unique perspectives on existential topics such as the consideration of what constitutes consciousness. I see
    the world through a holistic lens of Systems Theory. I believe that the universe in its whole is construed through incredibly
    complex interactions between different interdependant, interconnected systems.
    Consider your own conscious experience, just your atomic makeup is the product of several interwoven constituent systems. At its most
    foundational level you have quantum interactions, gravity, time to thank for your existence. These systems allow for complex cross-interaction
    and so emerge several more complex systems, atoms, molecules, cells, neuronal activity
    Consider yourself, you are a being who is capable of interacting with the external world, you seem to have some kind of inexplicable internal
    experience which is informed by a consistent self-identity and appear to contain free will.
    Now consider a rock. To us, it seems to be without conscious experience. It lacks the fundemental cognitive functions for us to consider
    it conscious with our current definition and understanding of the term. But if you look at this rock regarding a systematic model of understanding,
    the rock has a subjective perspective of the universe.
